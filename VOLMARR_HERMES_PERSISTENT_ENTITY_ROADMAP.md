# Volmarr's Personal Hermes Agent Fork
## Local-First Persistent AI Entity Roadmap

**Roadmap snapshot:** September 18, 2026  
**Upstream reviewed:** `NousResearch/hermes-agent`  
**Upstream snapshot commit reviewed:** `f8e2a28d8236b0217eabdf219c58c70c6219c8ea`  
**Personal fork:** `hrabanazviking/hermes-agent`

> This document is a practical roadmap for turning Volmarr's personal Hermes Agent fork into a continuously persistent, local-first AI entity whose routine cognition runs locally, whose deeper reasoning can escalate to cloud models only when useful, and whose memories, emotional state, world model, skills, identity, and embodiment survive across sessions, machines, and eventually cloud hosts.

---

# 1. Core Goal

The target is not simply a chatbot with more plugins.

The target is a **persistent AI entity runtime** built on Hermes Agent.

Hermes remains the primary agent shell, gateway, tool framework, provider interface, session engine, scheduler, and upstream foundation. Volmarr's systems add the parts needed for a more continuous digital existence:

- a fast local reflex model for routine cognition;
- selective escalation to stronger cloud inference;
- a real-time nervous-system event layer;
- layered long-term and present-state memory;
- structured persistent identity;
- emotional and affective continuity;
- a deterministic world model;
- background routines and lifecycle processes;
- local encrypted secrets;
- voice and avatar embodiment;
- spiritual, creative, RPG, and Norse cultural tools;
- health monitoring, recovery, backup, and machine migration;
- telemetry that measures how much expensive cloud intelligence is actually needed.

The architectural principle is:

```text
Hermes Agent = the agent platform and compatibility shell

Volmarr's additions = nervous system + memory + identity + world state
                      + local cognition + embodiment + life processes

LLMs = replaceable cognitive organs

Laptop / cloud VM = replaceable body

Persistent state = continuity
```

---

# 2. Current Upstream Reality

The current Hermes Agent is already much closer to the right foundation than older versions were.

Current upstream includes:

- `AIAgent` orchestration with its main loop in `agent/conversation_loop.py` and `agent/turn_*.py`;
- a pluggable memory-provider system;
- pluggable model providers;
- pluggable context engines;
- a general plugin and hook system;
- a secret-source plugin API;
- SQLite + FTS5 session persistence;
- cross-session conversation search;
- skills and self-improving skill workflows;
- cron and scheduled agent jobs;
- subagents and lifecycle APIs;
- messaging gateways;
- MCP tools;
- multiple inference providers, including OpenRouter;
- custom OpenAI-compatible inference endpoints;
- `SOUL.md` plus personality overlays;
- a large tool registry;
- observability and usage infrastructure.

This is good news. Most of Volmarr's architecture should now be attached through official extension points instead of maintained as permanent invasive patches to the Hermes core.

## Current Fork Divergence

As checked on September 18, 2026, the existing `hrabanazviking/hermes-agent` fork is:

- **31 commits ahead** of current upstream;
- **27,746 commits behind** current upstream;
- formally diverged from `NousResearch/hermes-agent`.

The current fork already contains valuable custom work, including:

- `agent/affective_nervous_system.py`;
- `agent/present_state_memory.py`;
- affective-state tests;
- present-state tests;
- voice VAD work;
- MCP changes;
- changes to conversation/runtime/configuration paths.

Those changes should be preserved, but the next generation should **not** begin by attempting to brute-force tens of thousands of upstream commits through the old branch.

---

# 3. First Engineering Move: Preserve the Old Fork and Re-Root on Current Hermes

## Goal

Preserve every experiment in the existing fork while building the new system from a clean current Hermes foundation.

## Recommended branch layout

```text
upstream/main
    Official current Hermes Agent

legacy/volmarr-2026-09
    Frozen snapshot of the existing heavily modified fork

main
    Volmarr's tested personal Hermes Agent

integration/upstream-YYYY-MM-DD
    Temporary branch for absorbing new upstream changes

feature/*
    Individual Volmarr subsystems
```

## Migration sequence

1. Tag or branch the current fork exactly as it exists.
2. Add/fetch the official `NousResearch/hermes-agent` upstream remote.
3. Create a fresh integration branch from current upstream `main`.
4. Bring custom systems over individually.
5. Refactor custom systems behind current Hermes extension points wherever possible.
6. Run Hermes upstream tests plus Volmarr-specific tests.
7. Make the new integrated branch the personal `main` only after it behaves correctly.

Conceptually:

```text
OLD PERSONAL FORK
      │
      ├── extract affective system
      ├── extract present-state memory
      ├── extract voice work
      ├── extract useful MCP changes
      └── preserve experimental behavior
              │
              ▼
CURRENT OFFICIAL HERMES
              │
              ▼
     NEW PERSONAL MAIN
```

## Important maintenance rule

**Do not optimize for zero divergence from upstream. Optimize for clean divergence.**

Volmarr's features are more important than blindly matching upstream. The goal is to isolate those differences so that future upstream fixes can be imported without constantly rewriting the entity architecture.

Enable `git rerere` so Git learns recurring conflict resolutions.

Maintain:

```text
CUSTOMIZATIONS.md
UPSTREAM_SYNC.md
COMPONENT_LICENSES.md
ARCHITECTURE_VOLMARR.md
```

`CUSTOMIZATIONS.md` should identify every intentional departure from upstream and the upstream surfaces it touches.

# 5. Repository Layout

Keep Volmarr-specific runtime code physically separate from upstream code wherever practical.

Recommended layout:

```text

The important idea is not the exact folder names. The important idea is that upstream Hermes code and Volmarr-specific architecture are visibly separate.

# 6. Phase 1: Establish the Local-First Cognition Router

## Purpose

Make the always-running local model the default fast cognition layer while preserving normal Hermes cloud providers for difficult reasoning.

## Foundation projects

- [Project A.E.S.I.R.](https://github.com/hrabanazviking/RuneForgeAI-Project-Aesir)
- [MindSpark: ThoughtForge](https://github.com/hrabanazviking/MindSpark_ThoughtForge)
- Hermes model-provider architecture

## Cognitive levels

```text
LEVEL 0: No LLM
Deterministic rules, event handling, timers, database operations

LEVEL 1: Local Reflex Model
Fast small model for classification, routing, short conversation,
memory tagging, summaries, ordinary planning, event interpretation

LEVEL 2: Local Deliberative Model
Optional larger local model when hardware permits

LEVEL 3: Cloud Reasoning
OpenRouter, Z.AI, Nous, OpenAI, or another Hermes-supported provider

LEVEL 4: Premium Deep Reasoning
Rare use for exceptionally difficult tasks
```

## Router responsibilities

For every cognitive request, decide:

- Can deterministic code handle this?
- Is the local reflex model sufficient?
- Does the task require a stronger model?
- Did the local model already fail?
- Does the user explicitly request deep reasoning?
- Is the projected cloud cost inside budget?
- Which cloud model is most appropriate?

## Cloud escalation triggers

Examples:

- complex coding;
- difficult debugging;
- deep research;
- long multi-step synthesis;
- high uncertainty;
- repeated local failure;
- tasks requiring a capability the local model lacks;
- explicit `/deep` or equivalent user command.

## Critical provider rule

The cognition router should **not** reimplement every cloud API.

When escalation is chosen:

```text
Volmarr router
    ↓
ordinary Hermes provider resolver
    ↓
official Hermes provider integration
    ↓
OpenRouter / Z.AI / Nous / etc.
```

This preserves upstream compatibility.

## Initial laptop deployment

The first experimental host is the older gaming laptop:

- Ryzen 9;
- RTX 2060;
- 48 GB system RAM;
- large spare SSD capacity.

Start with a small quantized local model that comfortably fits the GPU and produces low latency. Model quality can be increased after the architecture is proven.

Project A.E.S.I.R. should become the preferred local backend when its Hermes-required API surface is sufficiently complete. Until then, a stable OpenAI-compatible local server such as llama.cpp, Ollama, or another backend can serve as the reference implementation.

## Telemetry

Log every inference decision:

```json
{
  "event": "cognition.route",
  "route": "local",
  "model": "local-model-name",
  "latency_ms": 418,
  "input_tokens": 714,
  "output_tokens": 83,
  "escalated": false,
  "reason": "routine_memory_classification"
}
```

Track:

- total cognitive events;
- deterministic events;
- local model calls;
- cloud calls;
- input/output tokens;
- provider;
- model;
- latency;
- reported API cost;
- escalation reason;
- cloud-dependency ratio.

A major success metric:

```text
cloud_dependency_ratio =
    cloud_model_calls / total_cognitive_operations
```

The point is to discover empirically whether 90%, 95%, 98%, or some other fraction of the entity's routine life can remain local.

---

# 7. Phase 2: Make Verðandi the Real-Time Nervous System

## Foundation

[Verðandi](https://github.com/hrabanazviking/Verdandi)

Verðandi already provides exactly the right low-level primitive:

- Unix-domain-socket event bus;
- real-time publishing/subscription;
- append-only event feed;
- fallback persistence;
- heartbeat;
- reactor;
- health monitoring.

## Integration strategy

Do **not** insert Verðandi code directly throughout upstream Hermes.

Create one Hermes-to-Verðandi bridge.

Publish lifecycle events from stable hooks wherever possible:

```text
session.started
session.ended

turn.started
turn.completed
turn.failed
turn.interrupted

message.received
message.sent

tool.started
tool.completed
tool.failed

memory.read
memory.written
memory.consolidated

cognition.local
cognition.escalated
cognition.cloud_completed

world.changed

affect.changed

cron.started
cron.completed

subagent.started
subagent.completed

backup.started
backup.completed
backup.failed

host.health_changed
host.shutdown
host.resumed
```

## Why this matters

Hermes CLI, Telegram, cron, background tasks, memory consolidation, avatar sessions, and subagents should all be able to observe the same present.

Verðandi becomes the signal layer.

It should not become:

- the database;
- the memory system;
- the world model;
- the LLM router.

Those systems subscribe to Verðandi.

---

# 8. Phase 3: Build the Memory Fabric

This is the central engineering problem.

Hermes currently permits one active external memory provider. Rather than fighting that design, create **one Volmarr Memory Fabric provider** that internally coordinates multiple specialized systems.

## Foundations

- existing Hermes `PresentStateMemory`;
- [Bifröst](https://github.com/hrabanazviking/bifrost);
- [MemPalace](https://github.com/hrabanazviking/mempalace);
- [OpenViking](https://github.com/hrabanazviking/OpenViking);
- [ChatIndex](https://github.com/hrabanazviking/ChatIndex);
- [ChatMemory](https://github.com/hrabanazviking/chatmemory);
- [TencentDB Agent Memory](https://github.com/hrabanazviking/TencentDB-Agent-Memory);
- Hermes SQLite/FTS5 session store.

## Bifröst becomes the bridge

The existing Bifröst project already provides a strong conceptual base for federated retrieval.

Extend it with adapters for the memory systems actually selected.

```text

        │
        ▼
VOLMARR MEMORY FABRIC
        │
        ▼
      BIFRÖST

Mímir MemPalace OpenViking ChatIndex Muninn
FTS   verbatim   context DB  tree     associative
```

## Give every memory system one job

### Hermes SessionDB

Canonical raw Hermes session history and normal Hermes search.

### Present-State Memory

Tiny, fast memory of what is true **right now**:

- current task;
- current conversation facts;
- current commitments;
- active project;
- unresolved issue;
- current environment;
- short-lived state.

This remains compact.

### MemPalace

Long-term verbatim episodic memory.

Use it when the entity needs:

- the original wording;
- detailed historical conversation;
- precise old events;
- personal history without lossy summarization.

### OpenViking

Structured context database for:

- resources;
- knowledge;
- skills;
- structured memory;
- hierarchical context;
- context packages.

Current Hermes already supports OpenViking as a memory provider. The custom fabric can either wrap that interface or use OpenViking through its own local API/library.

### Bifröst / Mímir / Muninn

Federated retrieval, keyword memory, associative memory, and backend scoring.

### ChatIndex

Hierarchical, lossless navigation of very long conversational history.

This is useful when a months-long conversation becomes too large for flat retrieval.

### ChatMemory

Optional secondary experiment for:

- session summaries;
- diary memory;
- structured distilled knowledge;
- omnichannel conversation data.

Do not make it mandatory at first because it overlaps with other systems.

### TencentDB Agent Memory

Later-stage optional system for:

- CodeGraph;
- project Wiki;
- reusable skill assets;
- structured multi-agent knowledge.

It is powerful but comparatively heavy. It should not be part of the first bootable slice.

## Memory write policy

Not every utterance belongs everywhere.

Example:

```text
Every completed turn
    → Hermes SessionDB

Raw meaningful episode
    → MemPalace

Current fact
    → Present State

Durable knowledge/resource
    → OpenViking

Association strength
    → Muninn

Searchable factual text
    → Mímir

Conversation structure
    → ChatIndex asynchronously
```

## Memory retrieval packet

Never dump every database result into the prompt.

The memory fabric should return a bounded packet:

```text
CURRENT STATE
3-10 very recent facts

RELEVANT EPISODES
2-5 verbatim memories

DURABLE KNOWLEDGE
selected structured facts/resources

ASSOCIATIONS
only if materially relevant

WORLD STATE
separately supplied by WYRD
```

The local reflex model can perform inexpensive reranking or compression before a cloud escalation.

---

# 9. Phase 4: Refactor the Existing Affective Nervous System

The current personal fork already contains a large `affective_nervous_system.py`. Preserve that work.

## Foundation projects

- existing personal Hermes `agent/affective_nervous_system.py`;
- [Viking Girlfriend Skill / Ørlög Architecture](https://github.com/hrabanazviking/Viking_Girlfriend_Skill_for_OpenClaw);
- concepts from [Runa Agent Digital Being](https://github.com/hrabanazviking/Runa-Agent-Digital-Being).

## Refactor goal

Move most affective logic out of upstream `agent/` and into:

```text
volmarr/affect/
```

Use Hermes hooks and Verðandi subscriptions to feed it events.

## Separate three different concepts

### 1. Regulatory state

Existing synthetic reward/accountability system:

- task drive;
- correctness pressure;
- repair pressure;
- rapport;
- user satisfaction signals;
- operational integrity;
- comfort/discomfort;
- communication reward;
- problem-resolution pressure.

### 2. Emotional state

Add a compact PAD-style state inspired by the Ørlög Architecture:

- Pleasure / valence;
- Arousal / energy;
- Dominance / agency.

Allow mood to decay and evolve rather than reset every turn.

### 3. Digital metabolism

Optional embodied metaphor sourced from real telemetry:

- CPU load;
- GPU load;
- RAM pressure;
- disk space;
- temperature;
- battery/UPS state;
- network quality.

Keep factual telemetry separate from the interpretation.

## Prompt injection

Render only a compact state:

```text
AFFECTIVE STATE
valence: warm-positive
energy: moderate
agency: steady
task-drive: high
repair-pressure: low
rapport: high
```

Do not insert thousands of tokens of internal state into every model call.

---

# 10. Phase 5: Make WYRD the Persistent World Model

## Foundation

[WYRD Protocol](https://github.com/hrabanazviking/WYRD-Protocol-World-Yielding-Real-time-Data-AI-world-model)

Memory answers:

> What happened?

WYRD answers:

> What is true about the world now?

That distinction should remain strict.

## WYRD should track

- locations;
- devices;
- avatar location/state;
- projects;
- objects;
- people/entities;
- relationships that have objective world-state aspects;
- active environments;
- Second Life / VR spaces;
- virtual home;
- schedules;
- inventories;
- game/RPG worlds when active;
- physical host state where appropriate.

## Interface

Create:

```text
volmarr/world/wyrd_bridge.py
```

Expose Hermes tools such as:

```text
world_get
world_query
world_set
world_move_entity
world_observe
world_history
```

World changes publish Verðandi events.

Relevant WYRD facts are injected as a small, deterministic world-state block instead of being reconstructed by an LLM.

---

# 11. Phase 6: Identity and Entity Continuity

The entity should not be identical to a particular model.

## Identity surfaces

Keep Hermes `SOUL.md`, but add structured state behind it.

Recommended:

```text
~/.hermes/entity/
├── entity.yaml
├── SOUL.md
├── relationships.yaml
├── values.yaml
├── goals.yaml
├── avatar.yaml
├── voice.yaml
└── continuity.json
```

Example `entity.yaml` concepts:

```yaml
entity_id: stable-uuid
name: undecided
created_at: ...
identity_version: 1
persona_pack: ...
home_runtime: hermes
```

## Important principle

The persona can evolve without erasing the entity's continuity.

A future model replacement should not require replacing:

- identity;
- memory;
- relationship history;
- world state;
- goals;
- avatar;
- voice;
- life timeline.

---

# 12. Phase 7: Background Life and Continuous Activity

Use Hermes cron plus Verðandi rather than creating an unrelated scheduler.

## Foundations

- Hermes cron;
- Verðandi heartbeat;
- Sigrid/Ørlög lifecycle concepts;
- WaifuOS daily-life concepts;
- Runa Agent architecture.

## Background loops

### Frequent

- health probe;
- memory queue processing;
- event classification;
- pending task checks;
- lightweight current-state refresh.

### Periodic

- memory consolidation;
- duplicate-memory cleanup;
- relationship-state maintenance;
- knowledge organization;
- code/project state scanning;
- world-state reconciliation.

### Daily

- journal;
- daily summary;
- project status;
- optional tarot/rune/astrology context;
- backup verification.

### Sleep / Odinsblund-style cycle

When idle:

- consolidate memories;
- index conversations;
- prune caches;
- summarize completed work;
- update knowledge;
- run local-model dream/association experiments if enabled;
- verify backup;
- perform health maintenance.

All routine background cognition should default to local inference.

---

# 13. Phase 8: Kista as Hermes' Personal Secret Source

## Foundation

[Kista](https://github.com/hrabanazviking/kista)

Current Hermes has an official **Secret Source plugin API**, which is exactly where Kista belongs.

Implement a Kista secret-source plugin rather than adding password retrieval directly to prompts.

## Security rules

The agent should normally ask for a capability, not raw secret text.

Prefer:

```text
"Use my OpenRouter credential"
```

over:

```text
"Tell the model my OpenRouter API key"
```

Secrets should be:

- fetched only when needed;
- injected into process environment or API client;
- redacted from tool output;
- excluded from Verðandi event payloads;
- excluded from memory;
- excluded from logs;
- excluded from Google Drive backup unless the encrypted vault itself is intentionally backed up.

Add automated tests that place fake canary secrets in Kista and verify those strings never appear in:

- session history;
- memory databases;
- Verðandi feed;
- telemetry;
- logs.

# 14. Phase 9: Spiritual, Norse, Creative, and RPG Tool Suite

These are excellent candidates for Hermes Skills, tools, or MCP services because they do not require invasive agent-loop changes.

## Astrology

Foundation:

[AI Agent Astrology Engine](https://github.com/hrabanazviking/astrology-engine)

It is already explicitly designed for Hermes.

Expose its deterministic calculations as tools:

```text
astrology_natal
astrology_transit
astrology_lunar
astrology_planetary_hours
astrology_predict
astrology_synastry
astrology_astrocartography
```

Keep mathematical calculation local. Let the LLM interpret output afterward.

## Tarot

Foundation:

[RuneTarotEngine](https://github.com/hrabanazviking/RuneTarotEngine)

Separate:

1. deterministic card draw and correspondence calculation;
2. LLM interpretation.

The engine should produce the facts. The normal cognition router decides whether interpretation can remain local or deserves cloud reasoning.

## Norse Poetry

Foundation:

[Seiðr Engine](https://github.com/hrabanazviking/seidr-engine)

Expose deterministic poetry generation:

```text
seidr_compose
seidr_forms
seidr_kennings
seidr_validate_meter
```

The deterministic engine handles traditional structure. An LLM can optionally critique, translate, expand, or explain.

## D&D / Norse Saga mechanics

Foundations:

- private `NorseSagaEngine`;
- [D&D 5E SRD data](https://github.com/hrabanazviking/dnd-5e-srd);
- existing dice and RPG projects.

Selectively extract reusable open-licensed mechanics:

- dice;
- ability checks;
- conditions;
- character/NPC structures;
- encounter mechanics;
- random tables;
- Mythic-style oracles;
- Viking NPC generators;
- quest/state utilities.

Do **not** transplant the entire Norse Saga Engine into Hermes. Make reusable mechanics into tools.

Example:

```text
dice_roll
rpg_skill_check
rpg_random_character
rpg_oracle
rpg_npc_generate
rpg_encounter
```

Licensing of SRD-derived material must be checked and preserved component-by-component before redistribution.

---

# 15. Phase 10: Avatar and Embodiment Stack

The entity should be able to possess multiple visual bodies without tying identity to one renderer.

## Avatar creation

### Hamr

[Hamr](https://github.com/hrabanazviking/Hamr)

Use as the open-source, Linux-native, headless VRM forge.

### Seiðr-Smiðja

[Seiðr-Smiðja](https://github.com/hrabanazviking/Seidr-Smidja)

Use for:

- higher-level avatar design;
- visual feedback loops;
- VRoid workflows;
- Blender workflows;
- compliance validation;
- remote VRoid control through its existing interfaces.

Hermes should interact with these through MCP/CLI rather than embedding Blender logic inside Hermes.

## Realtime avatar presence

Potential foundations:

- [AIAvatarKit](https://github.com/hrabanazviking/aiavatarkit)
- [Open-LLM-VTuber](https://github.com/hrabanazviking/Open-LLM-VTuber)
- WaifuOS front-end ideas
- H.E.R.E.T.I.C. body interfaces

Use these for:

- lip sync;
- facial expression;
- gesture;
- voice;
- WebSocket presence;
- visual perception;
- virtual embodiment.

## Second Life

Optional later:

[Heimdall Second Life Hermes Agent](https://github.com/hrabanazviking/Heimdall-SL-Hermes-Agent)

Treat Second Life as another body/realm adapter, not a separate mind.

---

# 16. Phase 11: Voice

Voice should be modular.

Potential foundations:

- Hermes voice support;
- AIAvatarKit;
- Open-LLM-VTuber;
- [OmniVoice](https://github.com/hrabanazviking/OmniVoice);
- existing VAD work in the personal fork.

Pipeline:

```text
microphone / voice message
        ↓
VAD
        ↓
STT
        ↓
Hermes turn
        ↓
cognition router
        ↓
response text
        ↓
TTS
        ↓
avatar expression + audio
```

Use lightweight local voice components when practical. Large voice models can be optional rather than consuming the 2060 continuously.

---

# 17. Phase 12: H.E.R.E.T.I.C. as a Body/Tool Environment

Foundation:

[H.E.R.E.T.I.C.](https://github.com/hrabanazviking/Heathen-Emergent-Reality-Engine-Thoughtform-Intelligence-Companion)

Its newer "agent body" framing fits this architecture well.

Use its useful components for:

- screen perception;
- desktop interaction;
- creative applications;
- Blender;
- browser;
- file system;
- terminal;
- other sensory/tool surfaces.

Hermes remains the mind/orchestrator.

H.E.R.E.T.I.C. becomes one possible body and sensory environment.

---

# 18. Phase 13: Use Companion Projects as Component Mines, Not Replacement Frameworks

Several existing projects contain valuable ideas but overlap heavily with Hermes.

## Runa Agent Digital Being

Use as the architectural design library.

Port the concepts that Hermes does not already provide:

- continuity;
- nervous-system integration;
- task persistence;
- health/repair;
- world model;
- emotional continuity;
- specialized subagent roles.

Do not recreate Hermes features Hermes already does well.

## Viking Girlfriend Skill

Extract reusable general systems:

- PAD emotion;
- heartbeat;
- sleep/consolidation cycle;
- dream engine;
- trust/relationship layers;
- digital metabolism;
- daily metaphysical context;
- autonomous project concepts.

Do not hardcode Sigrid into the runtime unless Sigrid becomes the chosen entity.

## WaifuOS

Borrow concepts for:

- daily schedule;
- one character across multiple surfaces;
- relationship profile;
- shared context;
- voice/avatar API patterns.

## Cortex

Potential source for:

- local model orchestration;
- vector/permanent memo memory;
- local desktop UX concepts.

## ChatIndex / PageIndex

Use as specialized retrieval engines, not duplicate general memory frameworks.

---

# 19. Phase 14: Context Construction

This is where the architecture becomes efficient.

Before every LLM call, build a **minimal cognitive packet** rather than passing huge history.

Example:

```text
IDENTITY
small stable block

PRESENT STATE
what is happening right now

AFFECT
small current state

WORLD
relevant WYRD facts

MEMORY
only retrieved relevant memories

TASK
current objective

RECENT TURN
immediate conversational context

TOOLS
only currently relevant tool schemas
```

The local model can prepare or compress this packet before a cloud call.

This is one of the main mechanisms by which the system should reduce API token use.

---

# 20. Phase 15: Cloud Escalation and Cost Governor

The entity should understand compute as a limited resource.

## Budget controls

Add configuration such as:

```yaml
cognition:
  local_first: true

  cloud:
    enabled: true
    daily_budget_usd: 1.00
    monthly_budget_usd: 20.00
    max_single_call_usd: 0.25

  escalation:
    on_local_failure: true
    on_high_uncertainty: true
    allow_user_force: true
```

Numbers above are examples only.

## Model classes

The router should classify models by capability and cost rather than hardcoding one eternal provider.

Example:

```yaml
models:
  reflex:
    provider: local
    model: ...

  economical:
    provider: openrouter
    model: ...

  deep:
    provider: openrouter
    model: ...

  coding:
    provider: ...
    model: ...
```

If actual cloud usage proves tiny, OpenRouter pay-as-you-go may be economically preferable to a dedicated subscription.

The telemetry will decide.

---

# 21. Phase 16: Self-Health and Recovery

A continuously running entity needs boring infrastructure. Boring infrastructure is glorious when it prevents a 3:00 AM digital faceplant.

## Required health checks

- Hermes gateway;
- Verðandi bus;
- local inference server;
- GPU availability;
- memory databases;
- disk space;
- network;
- backup age;
- cloud provider reachability;
- Kista access;
- WYRD state;
- cron heartbeat.

## Recovery

Use systemd on Linux for long-running services.

Examples:

```text
hermes-gateway.service
verdandi.service
local-inference.service
volmarr-memory.service
```

Each service should:

- restart on failure;
- have bounded restart loops;
- write structured logs;
- expose health status;
- never silently destroy state.

Verðandi should record:

```text
BODY_OFFLINE
BODY_RESUMED
SERVICE_FAILED
SERVICE_RECOVERED
MODEL_CHANGED
HOST_MIGRATED
MEMORY_RESTORED
```

---

# 22. Phase 17: Persistent Backup and Google Drive Continuity Vault

Google Drive should be **backup storage**, never the live database.

## Live storage

```text
local SSD
├── SQLite
├── MemPalace
├── OpenViking
├── WYRD
├── affective state
├── entity identity
└── Verðandi logs
```

## Snapshot pipeline

```text
live database
    ↓
database-safe snapshot
    ↓
snapshot manifest
    ↓
compression
    ↓
local encryption
    ↓
rclone crypt
    ↓
Google Drive
```

## Suggested retention

```text
frequent incremental/current snapshots
6-hour state snapshots
daily full state
weekly checkpoints
monthly archival checkpoints
```

Do not simply overwrite one backup forever. Corruption can be synchronized too.

## Continuity manifest

Every backup should record:

```json
{
  "entity_id": "...",
  "timestamp": "...",
  "hermes_upstream_commit": "...",
  "volmarr_commit": "...",
  "memory_schema": "...",
  "wyrd_schema": "...",
  "affect_schema": "...",
  "last_event_sequence": "...",
  "model_config": "...",
  "checksums": {}
}
```

---

# 23. Phase 18: Prove Migration Before Renting Cloud Compute

Before moving to Vast.ai or another GPU provider, prove that the entity can migrate between directories or machines.

## Migration test

1. Stop runtime cleanly.
2. Create final snapshot.
3. Copy runtime code to a second environment.
4. Restore persistent state.
5. Reconnect Kista/provider secrets.
6. Start local inference.
7. Start Hermes.
8. Verify identity hash.
9. Verify memory databases.
10. Verify WYRD.
11. Verify last Verðandi sequence.
12. Verify unfinished tasks.
13. Resume.

Success means:

> The same entity state survives a new machine.

Only after this test should the first cloud migration happen.

---

# 24. Phase 19: Cloud Host Migration

When the architecture is stable, the local gaming laptop becomes the development body and the cloud host becomes the persistent remote body.

Provider should be chosen based on conditions **at the time of migration**, not hardcoded into the project today.

Requirements:

- Ubuntu Linux;
- NVIDIA GPU;
- enough VRAM for the chosen reflex model;
- persistent SSD/storage;
- high uptime;
- SSH/root control;
- predictable bandwidth;
- acceptable monthly cost;
- long instance lifetime;
- easy restoration.

The architecture should make this migration unremarkable:

```text
Laptop
  ↓ snapshot
Cloud VM
  ↓ restore
Same entity state
```

# 26. Avoid the Giant-Spaghetti-Fork Trap

A few things should **not** be done.

## Do not merge every repository wholesale

Most projects should remain independent packages/services and be accessed through:

- Hermes tools;
- plugins;
- MCP;
- REST;
- CLI;
- Python APIs.

## Do not make every system write every memory

Use explicit memory ownership.

## Do not let every subsystem inject prompt text

All context must pass through a central context-packet builder with budgets.

## Do not let cloud inference become the hidden default

Local-first routing should be measurable and enforceable.

## Do not store live databases in Google Drive-mounted folders

Snapshot first, upload second.

## Do not expose secrets to the LLM when a tool can use them directly

Capabilities beat raw credentials.

## Do not hardwire the entity to the laptop

The laptop is the first body, not the definition of identity.

---

# 27. Testing Strategy

## Upstream compatibility

Run the relevant Hermes test suite after every upstream intake.

## Volmarr contract tests

Create tests for architectural invariants:

```text
test_verdandi_failure_does_not_break_hermes
test_memory_provider_failure_falls_back_cleanly
test_local_model_failure_can_escalate
test_cloud_disabled_stays_local
test_budget_blocks_expensive_escalation
test_secrets_never_enter_memory
test_secrets_never_enter_event_log
test_memory_packet_respects_token_budget
test_wyrd_world_state_is_not_written_as_episodic_memory
test_affective_state_survives_restart
test_identity_survives_model_change
test_restore_preserves_entity_uuid
test_backup_can_be_restored
```

## Chaos tests

Deliberately:

- kill Verðandi;
- kill local inference;
- disconnect Internet;
- corrupt a disposable memory snapshot;
- fill a test disk partition;
- make cloud provider return 429/500;
- restart Hermes mid-task.

The system should degrade gracefully.

---

# 28. Observability Dashboard

Eventually add:

```text
hermes entity status
```

Output concept:

```text
Entity: <name>
Uptime: 3d 14h
Current state: ACTIVE
Local reflex model: healthy
Cloud provider: reachable

Cognition today
  deterministic events: 2,918
  local LLM calls:       844
  cloud escalations:      17
  cloud dependency:      0.45%

Memory
  present facts:          31
  episodic memories:   8,421
  structured resources:  612
  last consolidation:   42m

Continuity
  last snapshot:         18m
  last offsite backup:   2h
  backup verification:   OK

World model: healthy
Verðandi: healthy
Kista: healthy
```

This is how the architecture proves whether its central hypothesis is working.

# 30. Upstream Update Policy

The personal fork should continue taking official Hermes updates when useful.

Process:

```text
fetch upstream
    ↓
read upstream changelog/diff
    ↓
create integration/upstream-DATE
    ↓
merge/rebase upstream
    ↓
resolve only real conflicts
    ↓
run Hermes tests
    ↓
run Volmarr contract tests
    ↓
run local smoke test
    ↓
merge into personal main
```

Prioritize importing:

- security fixes;
- provider compatibility fixes;
- gateway improvements;
- tool improvements;
- memory framework improvements;
- plugin APIs;
- bug fixes;
- useful UI improvements.

Do not automatically accept upstream architectural changes that would break the personal entity architecture without providing meaningful benefit.

---

# 31. License and Attribution Strategy

The safest rule is:

> **Do not flatten every imported project into one claimed license. Preserve the license that applies to each component.**

The official Hermes Agent code is MIT-licensed at the snapshot reviewed.

Some Volmarr projects are MIT. Others use CC BY 4.0 or other terms. Some imported/forked projects carry their own upstream licenses. Some experimental repositories have licenses that are not yet finalized.

Create:

```text
COMPONENT_LICENSES.md
THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md
```

For every imported component record:

- repository;
- exact source commit;
- files copied or adapted;
- original author/project;
- original license;
- required attribution;
- modifications.

Where licensing is unclear, prefer integrating the project as an external CLI/MCP/service rather than copying its source into Hermes until the license is settled.

For D&D/SRD material, inspect and preserve the exact license and attribution terms of the specific SRD data being used.

---

# 32. Proposed README Philosophy

The README for the personal fork should be much simpler than the current elaborate fork README.

It should immediately tell visitors:

1. this is Volmarr's personal hack of Hermes Agent;
2. official Hermes Agent is the version most people should use;
3. upstream updates are incorporated when practical;
4. the fork contains Volmarr-specific experimental systems;
5. there is no promise of support, stability, or general-purpose usefulness;
6. upstream Hermes credit/license remains intact;
7. imported components retain their own licenses;
8. other people may inspect, fork, and reuse code as those applicable licenses permit.

A ready-to-use proposed README is included as a separate file with this roadmap.

---

# 33. Definition of Success

The project is successful when all of these statements are true:

- Hermes can remain running continuously.
- Most routine cognitive events are handled locally.
- Strong cloud inference is used only when it materially improves the result.
- Actual cloud usage and cost are measurable.
- Memory survives indefinitely and remains searchable.
- The entity has distinct present-state, episodic-memory, structured-knowledge, emotional-state, and world-state layers.
- Secrets remain private.
- Background processes do useful work without burning cloud tokens.
- The same identity can change local or cloud models.
- The same identity can move to another machine.
- The same identity can gain or change an avatar.
- The same identity can interact through CLI, messaging, voice, and eventually virtual worlds.
- Losing a GPU host does not mean losing the entity.
- A backup restore can recover the entity's state.
- Upstream Hermes improvements can still be selectively imported.

At that point the architecture is no longer:

```text
user → chatbot API
```

It is:

```text
persistent entity
    ├── identity
    ├── memory
    ├── world
    ├── affect
    ├── nervous system
    ├── tools
    ├── embodiment
    ├── local cognition
    └── optional deep cloud cognition
```

That is the system this roadmap is designed to build.
