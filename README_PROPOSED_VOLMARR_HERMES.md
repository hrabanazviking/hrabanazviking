# Volmarr's Personal Hermes Agent Fork

This is **Volmarr's personal hack of [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent)**.

It is a heavily customized personal fork that keeps taking useful upstream Hermes Agent updates whenever practical, while adding experimental systems from my other AI projects.

## Most People Should Use Official Hermes Agent

This repository is built for my own machines, workflows, experiments, and long-term AI-entity project.

If you simply want Hermes Agent, you will almost certainly be better off using the official version:

This fork may diverge from upstream, contain unfinished experiments, change without warning, or depend on systems that only make sense for my own setup.

## What I Added / Am Integrating

The personal fork keeps Hermes Agent as the core agent framework while adding:

- **Local-first cognition** with a small fast local model for routine work and selective escalation to stronger cloud models only when needed.
- **Verðandi nervous system** for real-time events between Hermes sessions, tools, background processes, memory, and other components.
- **Expanded persistent memory** with present-state memory, federated second-brain retrieval, episodic memory, structured context, and long-conversation retrieval.
- **Persistent identity and continuity** designed so the AI entity can survive model changes, restarts, hardware changes, and eventual migration between local and cloud machines.
- **Affective and emotional continuity** based on my existing Hermes affective nervous system and other companion-agent experiments.
- **WYRD persistent world model** for deterministic world, location, entity, object, and environment state.
- **Kista encrypted secret storage** integrated through Hermes' secret-management system.
- **Local/cloud inference routing and usage telemetry** so routine cognition can remain cheap and fast while stronger models remain available on demand.
- **Background lifecycle systems** including heartbeat, maintenance, memory consolidation, health checks, sleep-style maintenance cycles, and recovery.
- **Encrypted continuity backups** for restoring the entity on another machine.
- **Astrology tools** from my local astrology engine.
- **Tarot and divination tools** from RuneTarotEngine and related work.
- **Old Norse poetry generation** from the Seiðr Engine.
- **Selected open-licensed D&D 5E / Norse Saga mechanics** for dice, RPG, oracle, character, and storytelling tools.
- **Avatar creation and embodiment** using Hamr, Seiðr-Smiðja, and related VRM/VRoid systems.
- **Voice and realtime avatar experiments** using components and ideas from AIAvatarKit, Open-LLM-VTuber, OmniVoice, and related projects.
- **Companion-agent lifecycle ideas** drawn selectively from Runa Agent, WaifuOS, my Viking companion experiments, and H.E.R.E.T.I.C.
- **Optional virtual-world embodiment**, including Second Life experiments.

## Development Approach

This fork tries to keep Volmarr-specific code isolated behind Hermes' existing extension points wherever practical:

- plugins;
- hooks;
- memory providers;
- model providers;
- context providers;
- secret sources;
- tools;
- skills;
- MCP services;
- external local services.

The goal is to keep taking useful upstream Hermes fixes and features without sacrificing the custom architecture.

## Personal Project Disclaimer

This is primarily **my own personal experimental build**, not a general-purpose Hermes Agent distribution and not a supported public product.

It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Nous Research.

You are welcome to study, fork, modify, reuse, or experiment with anything here **to the extent permitted by the license that applies to the relevant code**. I do not promise that my configuration will work for anyone else's system, and I do not provide any warranty or support guarantee.

## Licenses and Attribution

The Hermes Agent portions of this repository remain subject to the upstream Hermes Agent license and copyright notices.

Code or material adapted from my other projects, or from third-party projects I have forked or incorporated, remains subject to the license and attribution requirements of its source project.

Because the components do not all necessarily use the same license, this repository should maintain a component license/attribution record rather than pretending that every imported file has one universal license.

See:

- `LICENSE`
- `COMPONENT_LICENSES.md`
- `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`

for the applicable terms as this fork evolves.
